### <a name="about_me">About me</a>

I am a **Full Stack Junior Developer** with strong IT and scientific background and some procedural programming and management experience.  

After 7 years of mapping the North Sea and similar hydrographic jobs, I felt ready for a bigger adventure and bought a restaurant in the Canary Island.  

Being an owner and a manager, it has been a huge experience, learning on how to lead a team while at the same time manage the business at various levels.  
However things didn't turned out as expected, so me and my girlfriend packed up for a gap year in Thailand and around.  

Back in Europe, I felt my previous professions were not fullfilling me anymore so I started looking around.  
That is where I found this gem which is the Makers Academy 3 months web dev bootcamp and learned I am a born-to-be developer with exceptional interests on producing "beatiful code".

#### Humility

I can fail, I can be wrong, I am human and so prone to errors.
But with every failure and being wrong, comes also lessons and chances of improvement. 

I know that I have many areas in myself I need to improve e.g. difficulties in pairing.
During the course I asked for feedback and some of my pairing partners said had difficulties working with me because I was patronizing them.

This was difficult to hear but I am very grateful because I was able to make changes, for example, understand that such behaviour can be offending and, therefore, change the approach to share my knowledge with my peers.

I realise these behaviours is partly as a result of being from a different cultural background, some language barriers and previous work experience where I was working alone, following a chain of command, etc.

As a result of my actions, at the end of the course I received many compliments with the work I have done on myself.

#### Analythical thinker and fast problem solver
I have 8 years of experience on installing, configuring and fixing equipment and/or IT infrastructure.  
This, plus 10 years of coding for fun, developed myself as a strong analythical thinker, quickly dissecting how things works, isolating processes and unearth connections, leading to quarantine issues and promptly solve them.  

#### Eagle eye and fast at understanding code
I start teaching myself how to program and use UNIX environments more than 10 years ago now, by picking up code and ideas on the web (StackOverflow, blogs, docs and man pages) or paper (O'Reilly).  
This helped me developing an eye for code and the ability to quickly understand what the code is doing.  

#### Curious and fast learner
I am a curious person very happy to vary and explore in normal life.
This pleasure in changings developed an ability in me to quickly learn new tools and the way they work.  
For fun or for work, many times I picked up tasks and learned how to accomplish them in Linux, Perl, Python, VBA, R, Google Apps Script, etc  

#### Creative and innovator
When I see a problem, I cannot stop my mind in pitching solutions and find new method to accomplish task.    
One of the reason I started coding was to automatize tasks, at work or in my private life.  

#### Enthusiastic and passionated
I can be very passionated at the task I have been given, striving to deliver my best product.  
Where I have seen others shy away from difficulties, I mostly take the challenge and push to overcome obstacles.  

#### Code craftmanship and thorough testing
During Makers Academy I falled in love with the concept of "beautiful code".
My mission as a coder is now to deliver the most "beatiful code" possible, meaning code that is:
- clear: code reads almost as plain English and it's flow can be quickly followed and understood;
- elegant: code algorithms are neat and efficient at the same time;
- malleable: code welcomes changes and extensions.

TDD was another revelation: I found it so beatiful, helpfull and easy to code with tests on your side that I cannot think about surviving in this world without it.  

#### High responsibility 
I am used to spend weeks in oil rigs safety zones - where any incident has an high risk of stopping oil production at least or catastrofic losses at worse - and be responsible for the positioning of Remotely Operated Vehicle and divers in underwater operations, near structures or in open seas.  

Furthermore, I guided the deploy of features on empty seabeds or near structures and I found myself once in the position of redesigning the route of a flexible riser - a pipeline to platform connector.  

Sorely, I was supporting divers operations at Gannett Alpha in August 2011 overwatching the biggest oil leak of North Sea.  

#### Thrives under pressure
My 7 years offshore were mostly flying somewhere in the world, get on new vessels and know new people, new systems, new organizations, new projects.  
My shifts onboard were 6am-6pm or 12-12 or viceversa, 7 days a week, usually 4 weeks on/off.  

Quite a few times I had managers around me reminding the cost of stopping or delaying operations - which usually was starting at tens of thousands per day.  
  
All of these has been more cool and challenging than stressfull - such a great adventure!  

#### Sympathy with management humans
Owning a restaurant for a year gave me some good insights on how difficult can managers life be.  
Trying to be a "good" boss while constantly making choices and have to deal with their consequences (sometimes not happy), developed in myself an empathy with entrepreneurs.
