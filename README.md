### <a name="about_me">About me</a>

After 7 years of mapping the North Sea and other hydrographic jobs, I decided to drop the anchor and buy a restaurant in the Canary Island.  

Things didnt't went as expected so, a year later, I sold everything and took a gap year in Thailand with my girlfriend.  
When we finally decided it was about time to do something, we headed for the British Isles where I found this gem which is Makers Academy and learned I am a born-to-be developer with exceptional interests on producing (not just working but also) high quality code.  

My next step will be landing a job in company which mostly shares the Makers Academy ethics (Agile, SOLID, pair programming, TDD, open minded, diversity welcome) and I can't wait to see how these models fit in a professional environment! 

I can probably express myself at best in an environment which:
- values "doers": people who work hard, get passionate at their tasks and enjoy having something to show for their efforts,
- embraces creativity, innovation and independence of thought,
- emphasyse on delivering at high standards,
- has manager that spends good effort on team building,
- has an easy going office culture,
- comes with new challenges everyday.

### Skills
#### Analythical thinker and fast problem solver
I have 8 years of experience on installing, configuring and fixing equipment and/or IT infrastructure.  
This, plus 10 years of coding for fun, developed myself as a strong analythical thinker, naturally analizing events as driven by logic causes.   

This approach constantly helps me in quickly dissecting how things works, isolating processes and unearth connections, leading to quarantine issues and promptly solve them.  

### Eagle eye and fast at understanding code
I start teaching myself how to program and use UNIX environments more than 10 years ago now, by picking up code and ideas on the web (StackOverflow, blogs, docs and man pages) or paper (O'Reilly).  
This helped me developing an eye for code and the ability to quickly understand what the code is doing.  

Also, my general interest for the tech world helped me fill up holes in knowledge in different occasions.

#### Curious and fast learner
I am a curious person very happy to vary and explore in normal life and this reflects in my programming experience.  
Years before this course, for fun, I had given myself some tasks and learned how to accomplish them in Linux, Perl, Python or VBA, i.e..  
This pleasure in changings developed an ability in me to quickly learn new tools and the way they work.  

#### Creative and innovator
I am a creative person that is always happy to walk new path and find new method to accomplish task.  
When I see a problem, I cannot stop my mind in pitching solutions.  

#### Enthusiastic and passionated
I can be very passionated at the task I have been given, striving to deliver my best product.  
Where I have seen others shy away from difficulties, I mostly take the challenge and push to overcome obstacles.  

#### Thorough testing and attention to detail
During Makers Academy I learned about and falled in love with "beautiful code".  
My mission as a coder become to deliver the most "beatiful code" possible, meaning code that is:
- clear: code reads almost as plain English and it's flow can be quickly followed and understood;
- elegant: code algorithms are neat and efficient at the same time;
- malleable: code welcomes changes and extensions.

TDD was another revelation and I cannot think about surviving in this world without it.  

#### Numbers freak
A good part of hydrographic surveying involves filtering data on statistic models (Standard Deviation and 95% confidence as basic examples).  
Within it, I found out how keen I am on statistics, data and playing with it in general.  

#### Happy feedback receiver
I learned to positively receive feedback, even strong ones, deeply reflecting on them.  
I am also naturally open to find lessons from any experience - there is always one.  

#### Easy going colleague (NEED TO FIND A BETTER HEADER)
I like to guess on motivation behind behaviour of people and I always push in finding solutions to happily share this world with everyone, family, friends, colleagues and strangers, whenever possible.  

#### Used to highly professional and stressfull environments
My 7 years offshore were mostly flying somewhere in the world, get on new vessels and know new people, new systems, new organizations, new projects.  
My shifts onboard were 6am-6pm or 12-12 or viceversa, 7 days a week, usually 4 weeks on/off.  

List of clients rep I'm used to "feel breathing behind my shoulders" includes BP, Shell, Statoil and Dong Energy.  
I learnt being comfortable in participating at meetings with such gents and/or overwatching the delivery of the final product to them (organized data complete with reports).  
Quite a few times I had managers around me reminding the cost of stopping or delaying operations - which usually was starting at tens of thousands per day.  

I am used to spend weeks in oil rigs safety zones - where any incident has an high risk of stopping oil production at least or catastrofic losses at worse - and be responsible for the positioning of Remotely Operated Vehicle and divers in underwater operations, near structures or in open seas.  
But also guide the deploy of features on the seabed and I found myself once in the position of redesigning the route of a flexible riser.  

I was at Gannett Alpha in August 2011 overwatching the biggest oil leak of North Sea.  
  
All of these was more cool and challenging than stressfull - such a great adventure!  
Apart the last one, obviously...

#### Empathy with management "humans"
Owning a restaurant for a year gave me some good insights on how difficult can managers life be.
Trying to be a "good" boss while constantly making choices and have to deal with their consequences (sometimes not happy), developed in myself a sympathy for business runners.

#### Manager

In 2015 I buyed a restaurant in Fuerteventura and worked in as a Manager where I found myself very involved in:
- Managing the different line of production, while studying for new and innovative way to improve the production itself and, therefore, the profitability of the business
- Developing a manner to manage the business using Google Drive plus other software, mainly Microsoft Office and Access
- Overseeing personnel work, attitude and motivation
- Customer engagement

Eventually, things didn't went very well and I managed to sell it but I'm still receiving compliments of the way the restaurant was doing!

Specifically, I was:
- collecting customer data for different reasons like:
-- building up statistics for operations (i.e. opening and busy hours to optimize shift: I was able to identify trends which led to change the opening hours from 8 to 11, managing to keep daily shifts of 20 hours total; one of my last objective was identifying periods and trends and correlation with clients preferences and help anticipating them to improve the production)
-- create a client DB: long term project was to create a kind of CRM and ordering system
- collecting production methods (i.e. creating a DB of recipes and tasks requested to make them, with workloads for personnel and tools/workplaces) for:
-- identify production bottlenecks and quickly study way for improving production: the idea was to cross the customer data with the DB recipe in order to clearly see when production was going behind and see if there were chances to avoid these delays by changing a recipe method i.e. 
-- identify workers performance and use this data to motivate them
- collecting invoices and other data and mix it all in Google Sheets to quickly generate balance and finance sheets
Most of these projects stopped halfway, nonetheless I had a good grasp at the challenges and requests of these problems.
I mostly used MS Office and Google Documents, but had a look at R and Python also.

#### Marine surveyor

Spent between 2008 and 2015, mostly in the North Sea, as a marine surveyor freelance, working on collection of data and the processing of it with specialized software, from different type of sensors, for different kind of marine projects: cartography; structure installation (i.e. pipe and gas lines, electrical cable for wind farms); vessel, divers and ROV positioning, etc

Work was like 12 hrs day/night, 7 days a week shifts for a monthish for clients of the alike of BP, Statoil, Shell, etc
[So a lot of pressure and adaptation to work situations and challenges, plus strongly international work environment]

On some projects I was required to mob and demob vessels: cablings; equipment installation, testing and calibration
On most of them I was due to create reports and QC data using Microsoft Office
Occasionly, I developed some excel VBA forms/sheets or small scripts in perl and python

#### IT Technician & Administrator

During 2008 at Geoteam SRL, Italy, I worked as an IT admin where I:
- developed a Debian server for the office giving services of SMB, MySQL (interfaced with MS Access), PostGIS (interfaced with AutoCAD Map
- created various programs on Access, Excel (with VBA) and some small scripts in Perl
- was administrating the network and Windows and Linux systems

#### IT Technician

Worked in 2007 at Microbusiness SRL, Italy as an IT Technician with tasks of:
- Onsite wireless / wired lan installation and configuration
- Onsite assistance and technical support
