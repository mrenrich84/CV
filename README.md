### <a name="about_me">About me</a>
Hey :)

I'm Enrico, a **Full Stack Junior Developer** with strong IT and scientific background and some management experience.  

I have a mixed, bold, love-hate feeling for **NodeJS**, especially when writing (and testing!) **ReactJS** - **API** coding with **TDD** IS just fun!  
I am very fascinated by the **OOA&D, SOLID, TDD and "beatiful code"** subjects.  
I have some knowledge in **HTML5 and CSS3**, experience with other languages such as **Python**, **VBA** and **Ruby** and also a **solid experience working with IT administration, GIS, SQL and DB analysis**.

I am a very relaxed and easy going person, looking forward to work in an **Agile** environment.
***
### <a name="history"></a>
In my early 20s, for personal amusement, I **self-taught** myself **Linux, Windows and net administration**, but also **Bash and Perl** scripting.  
That led me to [have been working as an IT technician and administrator](#it_admin) for 4 years.

After this job I spent several years working as a marine surveyor, like charting seabeds or supporting marine projects development - oil & gas, wind farms, telecomunications...  
I also owned a restaurant in the Canary Island for a year.  
During these years I **self learned** new skills, among many, **VBA, Python, SQL (M$ Access) and GIS**.

I then went to the **bootcamp** of this amazing organization which is **Makers Academy** where I graduated on March 2017.  
There, I was amused by lots of amazing coding techniques: **TDD, SOLID, software craftsmanship and clean code** but also **Agile** development - while we were playing with **HTML5, CSS3, Ruby and Javascript**.

Now I'm **looking for a great team** of people which will help me in **improving my knowledge** and **become a great Software Craftsman**, hoping to put my expertise at best use for our clients!

### Skills
- **Self-improvement and feedback-taker**
- **Analytical thinker and fast problem solver**
- **Charmed by coding and fast learner**
- **Thrives under pressure and high responsibility**

#### Self improvement and feedback-taker

I can fail, I can be wrong, I am human and so prone to errors: everyone of them is a lesson and chances of improvement. 
That's why I'm always open for feedback.  

During the course, I asked for feedback to all my colleagues.  
Some replied that had difficulties working with me because I was patronising them.  
This was difficult to hear, but I am very grateful because from their comment I was able to improve myself.  

In that case, understand that such behaviour can be offending to some and, therefore, change the approach to sharing my knowledge with my peers.  
As a result of my actions taken, at the end of the course, I received many compliments on the work I have done on myself.

#### Analytical thinker and fast problem solver
I have 10 years of experience in installing, configuring and fixing equipment, IT infrastructure and some coding.   
I am used to identifying problems and dissecting how things work together.  

As an example, during the Makers Academy course, we were given the task to debug an error.  
I started following what the code was doing, giving visibility to each interested line through console logging.  
This way, I was able to track the bug up to a faulty call in an external module.  
Found the bug, I started trying the least amount of correction necessary to make the code work properly until the software ran as expected.  

#### Charmed by coding and fast learner
I am very curious, charmed by coding with an innate ability to quickly learn new tools and the way they work.  

For fun, i.e., I learned how to use VBA in a couple of weeks.  
During my career, I used this skill to create several tools, like automating procedures in Excel or create special functionalities in Ms Access databases.  

#### Thrives under pressure and high responsibility
As an hydrographic (marine) surveyor consultant, my job is  mostly 6-6 or 12-12 day/night shifts, 7 days a week, usually 4 weeks on/off - flying somewhere in the world and work on new vessels, people, equipment, projects...  

My position is at an high profile.  
On a project, the vessel was due to collect precedently identified unexploded ordnances (UXO) from WW2 - my responsibilities were to manage highly sensible GPS and subsea positioning equipment for supporting UXOs recovering.  
Others tasks I had the opportunity to manage were setting up, maintain and manage positioning systems for correctly approach structures such as oil rigs or coordinate underwater activities between divers and ROV.
