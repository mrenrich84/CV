After 7 years of mapping the North Sea and other hydrographic jobs, I decided to drop the anchor and buy a restaurant in the Canary Island.  
After a year things didnt't went as expected so I sold everything and took a gap year in Thailand with my girlfriend.  
When we finally decided it was about time to do something, we headed for the British Isles where I found this gem which is Makers Academy and learned I am a born-to-be developer with exceptional interests on producing (not just working but also) high quality code.  
My next step will be landing a job in company which mostly shares the Makers Academy ethics (Agile, SOLID, pair programming, TDD, open minded, diversity welcome) and I can't wait to see how these models fit in a professional environment!  

## Skills

#### Manager

In 2015 I buyed a restaurant in Fuerteventura and worked in as a Manager where I found myself very involved in:
- Managing the different line of production, while studying for new and innovative way to improve the production itself and, therefore, the profitability of the business
- Developing a manner to manage the business using Google Drive plus other software, mainly Microsoft Office and Access
- Overseeing personnel work, attitude and motivation
- Customer engagement

Eventually, things didn't went very well and I managed to sell it but I'm still receiving compliments of the way the restaurant was doing!

Specifically, I was:
- collecting customer data for different reasons like:
-- building up statistics for operations (i.e. opening and busy hours to optimize shift: I was able to identify trends which led to change the opening hours from 8 to 11, managing to keep daily shifts of 20 hours total; one of my last objective was identifying periods and trends and correlation with clients preferences and help anticipating them to improve the production)
-- create a client DB: long term project was to create a kind of CRM and ordering system
- collecting production methods (i.e. creating a DB of recipes and tasks requested to make them, with workloads for personnel and tools/workplaces) for:
-- identify production bottlenecks and quickly study way for improving production: the idea was to cross the customer data with the DB recipe in order to clearly see when production was going behind and see if there were chances to avoid these delays by changing a recipe method i.e. 
-- identify workers performance and use this data to motivate them
- collecting invoices and other data and mix it all in Google Sheets to quickly generate balance and finance sheets
Most of these projects stopped halfway, nonetheless I had a good grasp at the challenges and requests of these problems.
I mostly used MS Office and Google Documents, but had a look at R and Python also.

#### Marine surveyor

Spent between 2008 and 2015, mostly in the North Sea, as a marine surveyor freelance, working on collection of data and the processing of it with specialized software, from different type of sensors, for different kind of marine projects: cartography; structure installation (i.e. pipe and gas lines, electrical cable for wind farms); vessel, divers and ROV positioning, etc

Work was like 12 hrs day/night, 7 days a week shifts for a monthish for clients of the alike of BP, Statoil, Shell, etc
[So a lot of pressure and adaptation to work situations and challenges, plus strongly international work environment]

On some projects I was required to mob and demob vessels: cablings; equipment installation, testing and calibration
On most of them I was due to create reports and QC data using Microsoft Office
Occasionly, I developed some excel VBA forms/sheets or small scripts in perl and python
