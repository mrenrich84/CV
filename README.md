### <a name="about_me">About me</a>

I am a **Full Stack Junior Developer** with strong IT and scientific background and some procedural programming and management experience.  
I will express myself at best in an environment which:
- values "doers": people who work hard, get passionate at their tasks and enjoy having something to show for their efforts,
- embraces creativity, innovation and independence of thought,
- emphasyse on delivering at high standards,
- has management investing good effort on team building,
- has an easy going office culture,
- comes with new challenges everyday.

After 7 years of mapping the North Sea and other hydrographic jobs, I decided to drop the anchor and buy a restaurant in the Canary Island.  

Things didnt't went as expected so, a year later, I sold everything and took a gap year in Thailand with my girlfriend - trying to create a trip vlog which had a ridicously bad outcome.  

After that trip, I took some time to perform a big retrospective on myself and, based on my qualities and my motivations, find a new career.
I found this gem which is the Makers Academy 3 months web dev bootcamp and learned I am a born-to-be developer with exceptional interests on producing "beatiful code".  

My next step will be landing a job in a company which mostly shares the Makers Academy ethics (Agile, SOLID, pair programming, TDD, open minded, diversity welcome) and I can't wait to see how these models fit in a professional environment!

#### Analythical thinker and fast problem solver
I have 8 years of experience on installing, configuring and fixing equipment and/or IT infrastructure.  
This, plus 10 years of coding for fun, developed myself as a strong analythical thinker, quickly dissecting how things works, isolating processes and unearth connections, leading to quarantine issues and promptly solve them.  

#### Eagle eye and fast at understanding code
I start teaching myself how to program and use UNIX environments more than 10 years ago now, by picking up code and ideas on the web (StackOverflow, blogs, docs and man pages) or paper (O'Reilly).  
This helped me developing an eye for code and the ability to quickly understand what the code is doing.  

#### Curious and fast learner
I am a curious person very happy to vary and explore in normal life.
This pleasure in changings developed an ability in me to quickly learn new tools and the way they work.  
For fun or for work, many times I picked up tasks and learned how to accomplish them in Linux, Perl, Python, VBA, R, Google Docs, etc  

#### Creative and innovator
When I see a problem, I cannot stop my mind in pitching solutions and find new method to accomplish task.    
One of the reason I started coding was to automatize tasks, at work or in my private life.  

#### Enthusiastic and passionated
I can be very passionated at the task I have been given, striving to deliver my best product.  
Where I have seen others shy away from difficulties, I mostly take the challenge and push to overcome obstacles.  

#### Code craftmanship and thorough testing
During Makers Academy I falled in love with the concept of "beautiful code".
My mission as a coder is now to deliver the most "beatiful code" possible, meaning code that is:
- clear: code reads almost as plain English and it's flow can be quickly followed and understood;
- elegant: code algorithms are neat and efficient at the same time;
- malleable: code welcomes changes and extensions.

TDD was another revelation: I found it so beatiful, helpfull and easy to code with tests on your side that I cannot think about surviving in this world without it.  

#### Attention to detail
I worked in situations where people were not given standards or nobody was paing attention to them, others where companies constrained the use of correct naming and log entries.
Throught these experiences, I learned the importance of being a details maniac and consider your colleagues while working on a project. 

On a vessel where I worked for a year, I have been given the task to write a manual for defining standards while at same time I developed a series of checklist for reducing errors and mantaining the quality of the work high.

#### Numbers freak
A good part of hydrographic surveying involves filtering data on statistic models (Standard Deviation and 95% confidence as basic examples) and this uncovered a part of me keen on statistics, data and playing with it in general.  

When I buyed the restaurant, I suddenly started collecting the most data as possible, which then I used to redefine opening hours, personnel shifts, but also to redefine production or assess structural changes of the establishment.

#### Happy feedback receiver
I learned to positively receive feedback, even strong ones, deeply reflecting on them.  
I am also naturally open to find lessons from any experience - there is always one.  

#### Empathic colleague
I like to guess on motivation behind behaviour of people and I always push in finding solutions to happily share this world with everyone - family, friends nad colleagues but strangers also - whenever possible.  
  
Living onboard vessels, 24 hours a day for usually a month, shoulder to shoulder with my workmates, sharing a cabin perhaps, really teached me on how to avoid major confrontation, keep character clash at a minimum and reach for a positive office environment.  

#### High professionality
A list of people I am used to "feel breathing over my shoulders" includes clients rep from BP, Shell, Statoil and Dong Energy.  
I learnt being comfortable in participating at meetings with such gents and/or overwatching the delivery of the final product to them  - organizing data usually based on client standard and summarizing reports on work methodology and results.  

#### High responsibility 
I am used to spend weeks in oil rigs safety zones - where any incident has an high risk of stopping oil production at least or catastrofic losses at worse - and be responsible for the positioning of Remotely Operated Vehicle and divers in underwater operations, near structures or in open seas.  

Furthermore, I guided the deploy of features on empty seabeds or near structures and I found myself once in the position of redesigning the route of a flexible riser - a pipeline to platform connector.  

Sorely, I was supporting divers operations at Gannett Alpha in August 2011 overwatching the biggest oil leak of North Sea.  

#### Thrives under pressure
My 7 years offshore were mostly flying somewhere in the world, get on new vessels and know new people, new systems, new organizations, new projects.  
My shifts onboard were 6am-6pm or 12-12 or viceversa, 7 days a week, usually 4 weeks on/off.  

Quite a few times I had managers around me reminding the cost of stopping or delaying operations - which usually was starting at tens of thousands per day.  
  
All of these has been more cool and challenging than stressfull - such a great adventure!  

#### Sympathy with management humans
Owning a restaurant for a year gave me some good insights on how difficult can managers life be.  
Trying to be a "good" boss while constantly making choices and have to deal with their consequences (sometimes not happy), developed in myself an empathy with entrepreneurs.

#### Italian, English and Spanish literate
Italian mothertongue.  
English and Spanish, fluent in spoken and written.
