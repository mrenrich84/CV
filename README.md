### <a name="about_me">About me</a>

I am a **Full Stack Junior Developer** with strong IT and scientific background and some procedural programming and management experience.  

After 7 years of charting the North Sea and others marine surveyor jobs, I felt ready for a bigger adventure and bought a restaurant in the Canary Island.  

Being an owner and a manager, it has been a huge experience, having the opportunity to lead a team while at the same time manage the business at various levels.  
However things didn't turn out as expected, therefore me and my girlfriend packed up for a gap year in Thailand and around.  

Back in Europe, I felt my previous professions were not fulfilling me anymore so I started looking around.  
That is where I found this gem which is the Makers Academy 3 months web dev boot camp and learned I am a born-to-be developer with exceptional interests on producing "beautiful code".

### Skills
- **Self-improvement**
- **Analytical thinker and fast problem solver**
- **Charmed by coding and fast learner**
- **Thrives under pressure and high responsibility**

#### Self improvement

I can fail, I can be wrong, I am human and so prone to errors.  
But with every failure and being wrong, comes also lessons and chances of improvement. 

I know that I have many areas in myself I need to improve, so I am always open or ask for feedback.  
For example, during the course, I asked for feedback and some of my pairing partners said had difficulties working with me because I was patronising them.

This was difficult to hear but I am very grateful because I was able to improve myself, for example, understand that such behaviour can be offending and, therefore, change the approach to sharing my knowledge with my peers.

I realise these behaviours is partly as a result of being from a different cultural background, some language barriers and previous work experience where I was working alone, following a chain of command, etc.

As a result of my actions, at the end of the course, I received many compliments on the work I have done on myself.

#### Analytical thinker and fast problem solver
I have 10 years of experience in installing, configuring and fixing equipment, IT infrastructure and some coding.   
I am used to identifying problems and dissecting how things work together.  

As an example, during the Makers Academy course, we were given the task to debug an error.  
I started following what the code was doing, giving visibility to each interested line through logging.  
This way, I was able to track the bug up to a faulty call in an external module.  
Found the bug, I started trying the least amount of correction necessary to make the code work properly until the software ran as expected.  

#### Charmed by coding and fast learner
I am a curious person, charmed by coding with an ability to quickly learn new tools and the way they work.  

For fun, i.e., I learned how to use VBA in a couple of weeks.  
During my career, I used this skill to create several tools, like automating procedures in Excel or create special functionalities in Ms Access databases.  

#### Thrives under pressure and high responsibility
My 7 years as hydrographic surveyor consultant were mostly 6am-6pm or 12-12 shifts, 7 days a week, usually 4 weeks on/off - flying somewhere in the world and work on new vessels, people, equipment, projects  

My position was at a high profile.  
On a project, my vessel was due to collect precedently identified unexploded ordnances (UXO) from WW2 - my responsibilities were to manage highly sensible GPS and subsea positioning equipment and to navigate the master to these ordnances.  s
Others tasks I had the opportunity to manage were setting up, maintain and manage positioning systems for correctly approach structures such as oil rigs or coordinate divers and ROV activities.
